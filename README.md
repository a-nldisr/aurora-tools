# Read only
Since the aurora community no longer released artifacts to the bintray repository, i have decided to mark this repo as read only. 

# Aurora-tools
Aurora tools provides the client and admin tools for interfacing with Apache Aurora clusters. The official Apache Aurora tools provided on bintray are contained in this Docker image, this mainly is for the ease of switching between Apache Aurora versions when you are working with several Apache Aurora clusters which are running different versions. 

You can use them in combination with some dotfiles locally, example:
