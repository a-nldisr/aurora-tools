# aurora-tools
Aurora tools can be used with Apache Aurora. Aurora tools are contained in a Docker image, this makes switching between versions easy. The goal of this project is to provide all official packaged versions of Apache Aurora from 0.12 for connecting to an Apache Aurora cluster.

You can use them in combination with some dotfiles
