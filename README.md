# aurora-tools
Aurora tools is the client that can used to talk with Apache Aurora. The Aurora tools are contained in a Docker image, this makes switching between versions easy when you are working with several Aurora clusters running different versions. The goal of this project is to provide all official packaged versions of Apache Aurora from 0.12 for connecting to an Apache Aurora cluster.

You can use them in combination with some dotfiles
